Hello there!

I'm a software developer living in Winnipeg, Canada. I have a curiosity for
non-mainstream programming languages and what they have to teach, and I'm keen 
to improve my chops as a developer. I have a lot left to learn.

Fitness kickboxing has become an important part of my life. I'm not a fighter, 
but I do appreciate the health benefits. It's a fantastic, but very demanding
workout. 

I've played guitar on-and-off since my teens. I love music, and if I was rich
enough to do anything I like, I would spend my time learning instruments and
making music.

Feel free to get in touch. I'd love to hear from you.
